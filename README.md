# CS2410 Assignment 3 Description
# Not a real resume

It turns out that the Metaverse is probably not the future and mortgage calculators and MadLib generators were overhyped by your research and development team after, it turns out, they didn't actually do any market research and instead spent all of their hours at work watching the world cup. Because of these developments, Widgets R' Us has laid off all of its Metaverse development team and you find yourself in need of new job. You decide that your old résumé needs some spiffing up.

Objectives
Write some CSS.
Requirements
Part 1: Flex-box Froggy
Flex-box froggy is a great place to learn flex-box and is the first part of this assignment. Go to https://flexboxfroggy.com/Links to an external site. and complete all 24 levels. When you reach the end of the game, take a screenshot of the congratulations page - you will upload that screenshot as part of your submission. When you get to level 24, it is pretty trick. For that one, feel free to google search a solution to it because its not worth getting stuck on.

Part 2: Resume
You are going to make a resume. 

Your resume should have the following sections.

Header
The header should display your name and contact information.

Education
You should put your education in this section. You should have at least 3 entries (you can make them up if you want).

Prior Work Experience
This section should have 5 entries (again, feel free to make some or all of them up). Each entry should tell me the following information:

1. The name of the Company you worked for

2. Your job title

3. How long you worked their for

4. A sentence describing your primary responsibility

Programming Languages and Familiar Technology
This section should list at least 9 programming languages / technologies that you are familiar with (make some up if you need).

Styling
Your resume should be styled and look good. I recognize that looking good is an entirely subjective measurement and I won't be too picky. But, you should be doing the following at least:

1. Proper spacing.

2. Good use of color

3. Nice font(s)

4. Flex-box for positioning where appropriate.

I will be grading style mostly based on apparent effort.
